# 🦄 **Unicorn Company: Data Exploration & Insights**  

---

## 📄 **Context**  
Unicorn is a family-owned e-commerce business specializing in three key product categories: technology, furniture, and office supplies. While the company has already accumulated a significant amount of data, its data analysis (DA) team is currently in the process of expanding.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The objective of this project was to develop an interactive dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into sales performance, profitability, and order trends from 2015 to 2018. The dashboard enables users to filter results by time period, region, and product category, ensuring quick access to relevant business insights.

---

## 🚀 **Approach and Implementation**  
To achieve this, I designed an interactive dashboard that consolidates key performance indicators (KPIs) to facilitate data-driven decision-making. The analysis revealed several notable trends:
	- **Steady sales growth over time**, with seasonal peaks in September and a temporary decline in October. Sales recover in November, culminating in a peak during the holiday season.
	- Technology products accounted for both the highest and lowest-performing items. **The poorest-performing products were heavily discounted**, resulting in significant losses.
	- Variations in category performance: While office supplies and technology consistently contributed to overall profitability, the furniture category exhibited **inconsistent 		performance** across its subcategories.

## 📊 **Project Steps**  

1. **SQL Queries**  
   - Explored the Unicorn database using SQL to answer key questions about sales, profit, and customer behavior.  
   - Cleaned and joined tables, performed aggregations, and ranked cities, products, and regions by their performance.  
   - Documented queries to ensure reproducibility.  

2. **Google Sheets Analysis**  
   - Aggregated data using pivot tables to analyze performance by product category and customer segment.  
   - Developed calculated metrics (e.g., price per unit, profit margin).  
   - Applied conditional formatting to highlight opportunities for growth and underperforming regions.

3. **Tableau Dashboard**  
   - Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to present KPIs, trends, and actionable recommendations for business decision-making.

## 🔍 **Insights**  
- **High-performing regions:** The West and East regions generated the highest profits and order volumes.  
- **Product profitability:** Office Supplies and Technology were the main contributors to overall profitability, while certain Furniture subcategories underperformed.  
- **Significant losses on discounts:** Technology products with high prices and discounts exceeding 50% contributed to overall losses.  
- **Seasonal trends:** Sales peaked during November and December, with consistent growth across the analyzed period.

---

## 🔮 **Future Work**  
- **Analyze discount patterns:** Investigate why certain high-priced products were heavily discounted, and determine if there's a risk of fraud or inefficiencies in the discounting process.  
- **Expand data collection:** Gather additional data, such as return rates, product conditions, and customer feedback, to further refine product-level insights.  
- **Optimize product portfolio:** Discontinue or revamp underperforming products based on profitability and customer feedback.  
- **Expand marketing efforts:** Collaborate with the marketing team to increase order volumes in underrepresented regions (e.g., central states).

---

## 🌟 **Standout Section**  
- **Beyond Instructions:** While following the core requirements, I also explored subcategories, applied calculated metrics in Google Sheets (e.g., price per unit, profit margin), and customized Tableau filters for region-specific insights. This allowed for deeper analysis beyond basic KPIs.

## ✅ **Recommendations**  
- Investigate and address the high discounts on underperforming technology products.  
- Collaborate with the marketing team to increase order volumes in underrepresented regions.  
- Consider discontinuing or redesigning products with consistent losses or low performance.  
- Collect additional data (e.g., customer feedback, return conditions) to further improve product strategy.  

By addressing these recommendations, Unicorn has the potential to turn its current stable profit trend into a growing one.
