# ü¶Ñ **Unicorn Company: Data Exploration & Insights**  

---

## üìÑ **Context**  
Unicorn is a family-owned e-commerce business specializing in three key product categories: technology, furniture, and office supplies. While the company has already accumulated a significant amount of data, its data analysis (DA) team is currently in the process of expanding.

---

## üéØ **Objective**  
The objective of this project was to develop an interactive dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into sales performance, profitability, and order trends from 2015 to 2018. The dashboard enables users to filter results by time period, region, and product category, ensuring quick access to relevant business insights.

---

## üöÄ **Approach and Implementation**  
To achieve this, I designed an interactive dashboard that consolidates key performance indicators (KPIs) to facilitate data-driven decision-making. The analysis revealed several notable trends:
- **Steady sales growth over time**, with seasonal peaks in September and a temporary decline in October. Sales recover in November, culminating in a peak during the holiday season.
- Technology products accounted for both the highest and lowest-performing items. **The poorest-performing products were heavily discounted**, resulting in significant losses.
- Variations in category performance: While office supplies and technology consistently contributed to overall profitability, the furniture category exhibited **inconsistent 		performance** across its subcategories.

## üìä **Project Steps**  

1. **SQL Analysis**  
   - Conducted in-depth data exploration using SQL to analyze sales, profitability, and customer behavior.  
   - Cleaned and integrated datasets, performed aggregations, and ranked cities, products, and regions based on performance.  
   - Documented queries to ensure consistency and reproducibility.  

2. **Google Sheets Analysis**  
   - Utilized pivot tables to aggregate data and assess performance across product categories and customer segments.  
   - Created calculated metrics such as price per unit and profit margin to enhance analytical depth.  
   - Applied conditional formatting to identify growth opportunities and highlight underperforming regions.
     
3. **Tableau Dashboard**  
   - Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and strategic recommendations for data-driven decision-making.

## üîç **Insights**  
- **Top-performing regions:** The West and East regions achieved the highest profits and order volumes.  
- **Profitability by product category:** Office Supplies and Technology drove overall profits, while some Furniture subcategories showed weaker performance.  
- **Impact of high discounts:** Technology products with steep discounts (over 50%) and high prices led to significant losses.  
- **Seasonal patterns:** Sales reached their highest levels in November and December, showing steady growth throughout the analyzed period.

---

## üîÆ **Future Work**  
- **Review discount strategies:** Assess the rationale behind significant discounts on high-priced products to identify potential inefficiencies or fraud risks.
- **Enhance data collection:** Incorporate additional metrics, such as return rates, product conditions, and customer feedback, to improve product-level analysis.
- **Refine product offerings:** Adjust or discontinue underperforming products based on profitability trends and customer insights.
- **Strengthen marketing outreach:** Partner with the marketing team to drive sales growth in underrepresented regions, such as central states.

---

## üåü **Standout Section**  
- **Going Beyond the Basics:** In addition to meeting the core requirements, I analyzed subcategories, introduced calculated metrics in Google Sheets (e.g., price per unit, profit margin), and refined Tableau filters for region-specific insights. This enabled a more in-depth analysis beyond standard KPIs.

## ‚úÖ **Recommendations**  
- **Examine discount strategies:** Identify the reasons behind steep discounts on underperforming technology products and take corrective actions.
- **Boost regional sales:** Work with the marketing team to drive higher order volumes in underrepresented areas.
- **Optimize product lineup:** Discontinue or revamp consistently low-performing products to enhance profitability.
- **Enhance data-driven decisions:** Collect additional insights, such as customer feedback and return conditions, to refine the product strategy.

By implementing these strategies, Unicorn can shift from stable profitability to sustained growth.
